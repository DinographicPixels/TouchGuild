Join our [Guilded](https://guilded.gg/dinographicpixels) when adding features that aren't directly related to Guilded's API, make sure to look at existing pull requests before opening a new one.

### Guidelines:
- Ensure you are following the eslint rules. You can use `npm run lint` to test locally.
- Your pull request will not be merged without all three tests passing. (test code, test docs & lint)
- If a feature had been rejected, do not attempt to suggest it again.
- An understanding of Typescript, types, and how to use these effectively is required for contributing.
- Pull requests should always target the `dev` branch.
- Do not duplicate, or recreate abandoned or already opened pull requests.
